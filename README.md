1. Overview

MYSTAR BOX is a speculative augmented reality (AR) system designed to explore how museums and libraries might use gamified learning and data-driven engagement in the future. The project consists of two artefacts:  
- A seven-screen Figma UI prototype that illustrates the complete user journey.  
- A promotional website that presents MYSTAR BOX as a commercial product while subtly critiquing educational commercialisation and the gamification of culture.  


2. Running the Webpage

Option 1: Run Locally with VS Code  
1. Go to the repository: https://github.com/ZoeZheng0827/DECO-6500-A3-Fiction  
2. Download the ZIP file and extract it.  
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.  
4. Install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.  
5. Locate the file named "mystarboxads.html".  
6. Right-click the file and select "Open with Live Server".  
7. The webpage will open automatically in your browser.  

Option 2: View via GitHub  
You can browse all project files directly on GitHub, including HTML, CSS, and assets. The Figma link at the top allows access to the mobile prototype. You may also download or clone the repository to run it locally.  


3. Prototype Summary

Figma UI Mock Prototype  
The Figma prototype visualises seven key screens: scanning the QR code, receiving three boxes, opening one to reveal a mission, finding the Golden Mask of Tutankhamun, completing the mission to earn XP, viewing artefact details in AR, and accessing the reward dashboard and membership upgrades.  

Promotional Website (Ads Webpage)  
The website functions as a fictional marketing artefact for MYSTAR BOX. It conveys how educational systems might evolve into subscription-based platforms that quantify curiosity and reward engagement, reflecting a critical design fiction perspective.
